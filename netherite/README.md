Netherite is a crate implementing the essential building blocks of the Minecraft protocol.

Like a netherite ingot, it enables you to build your tools by yourself, offering traits and methods
for implementing your very own data types and packets.

This is because the Minecraft protocol is always changing, and a fixed, up-to-date implementation is
really hard to maintain.
